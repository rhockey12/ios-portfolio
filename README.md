Things I did in IOS Development:


About me app-
The first ios app I made was a really simple single view app that had 4 buttons and they pulled up 4 different pictures of me doing things I like to do with labels explaining them. By making this app, I learned how to create a simple UI by linking buttons and pictures to the code, and also how to format everything with restraints.

Give Me Your Money Slots-
This was the first game that I made without SpriteKit. It is just a simple slot machine where you start out with $1000 and you try to match 3 in a row. The different pictures have different values when you match them. You end up losing your money like 90% of the time, so I made it so you can transition to another screen to rob a bank to get more money. When you tap on the bank to get money, there is a chance the cops will catch you and you will lose money to pay them off. You get money more often than losing when you rob the bank, so the whole game is a cycle of losing your money in the slots and robbing the bank to get more.


Dodge Dude-
The next app I made was probably my best one and I worked on it for most of the first half of the class and continued to improve it in the second half. I made a simple retro style game with SpriteKit where you touch and hold the left and right half of the screen to move left and right while enemies fall from the top. You need to dodge the enemies while collecting the coins that fall. You can then use your coins to buy skins in the shop. I designed all the sprites and skins in an online sprite maker called Piskel. I also made background music for the game in an online music maker thing called Beep Box. I had to learn how to create sprites programmatically, and use SKActions. The hardest part of programming it was probably creating the physics bodies and handling collisions by checking if what dude was running into was a coin or an enemy. I tried to figure out how to run ads but I had to make the actual game before I could focus on the money making part. Then I made a moving space background to make everything look smoother, and also figured out how to use UserDefaults to save your money and the skins you bought. 


Battle Dudes-
Battle Dudes originally started out as a group project trying to make a dungeon crawler with a legend of zelda fighting style where you slash your sword at enemies. We made a tile map that looked like a dungeon and made a guy able to walk around with an arrow pad. We ran into a problem we couldn't solve when trying to make the sword slash and trying to make the enemies die from the sword, so my group members left to make another game and I was left with a tile map and a dude that could walk around. Because I couldn't make the sword, I decided to make a game like Pokemon. I reskined the dungeon to make it look like it was outside with trees and grass, and then I made a battle game scene that the game transitions to. I made 3 Battle Dudes so you could choose from 3 when the game started. Then I had to make some tall grass so when you walk through it, the game would transition to battle. I had to make a way to heal, so I tried to make health packs you could pick up, but the physics bodies weren't working, so I solved the problem by healing at the end of each battle you win. Then I made a goal to reach by making the map a huge maze you had to find your way through. 

2022 Spring UNL Cornhacks Project: https://github.com/Underdoneboar4/Brogatchi
I had a lot of fun participating in my first hackathon. I had to remember and relearn my skills from the IOS class I took in 2019 to complete this project. The theme of the competition was retro so we decided to make a tamogatchi virtual pet. The project ended up taking us 14 hours of work to complete. I felt accomplished after, despite not winning, because I proved to myself that I can make something awesome in such a short amount of time.
